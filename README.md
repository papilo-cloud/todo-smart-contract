# TODO Smart Contract

- Building a TODO smart contract that creates a new todo, replaces a todo, updates a todo, and deletes a todo.

- This refresher helps to learn Solidity with Foundry
- Once we have built the smart contract, we'll build a frontend client that communicates with the smart contract.
- The frontend client we will build uses NodeJS, React, and a wonderful frontend tool to build Ethereum applications, wagmi.sh.
