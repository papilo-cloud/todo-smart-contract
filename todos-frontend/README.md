# Building The Frontend with React and wagmi.sh

- We already have built the TODO smart contract with Solidity. Here we'll build a frontend client using NodeJS, React, and wagmi.sh.
- WIth wagmi.sh, we will be able to feel the ease of developing smart contracts with Typescript/Javascript.

**Outcome of the project**
- The goal of this tutorial is to allow us to perform smart contract transactions in the frontend and observe changes in the Sepolia block explorer with the added convenience of wagmi.
