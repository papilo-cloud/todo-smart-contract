# TODO Smart Contract

### Outcome of the project
- In this project, I build a smart contract that acts as a TODO List application. It creates new TODOs, updates TODOs, and deletes TODOs.
### Tools used

- I used Foundry, an Ethereum and smart contract development toolkit

**As a refresher**
 - Foundry manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts.
